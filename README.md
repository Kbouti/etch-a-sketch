Etch-A-Sketch project in Odin Foundations course https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

While this fulfills the requirements of the assignment I have not yet gone back to make the extra credit "rainbow" color work, nor have I implemented a click and drag user interface that might be more intuitive. I intend to return to this project and implement those changes.
